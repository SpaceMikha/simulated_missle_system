# Raspberry Pi Missile System

_A simple C++ missile system simulation for Raspberry Pi_

---

## Overview

This project is a **starting point** for a **Raspberry Pi-based missile system simulation** written in C++. It includes **basic missile operations**, **targeting**, **guidance**, and **defense mechanisms**. The system is designed to simulate **missile launching, tracking, and interception**, providing a foundation for further development.

**Disclaimer:** This is purely a **software simulation** and does not involve any real missile technology. It is intended for educational and entertainment purposes only.

## Features

**Missile System:** Simulates missile launching, fuel tracking, and self-destruction.  
 **Targeting System:** Acquires and locks onto enemy targets.  
 **Guidance System:** Calculates basic flight trajectories.  
 **Weather System:** Affects missile accuracy with different weather conditions.  
 **Radar System:** Detects enemy threats.  
**Defense System:** Deploys countermeasures to intercept enemy missiles.

## How It Works

- Target Acquisition: The system locks onto an enemy target.
- Weather Check: Weather conditions are generated randomly and may impact launch decisions.
- Threat Detection: The radar scans for enemy threats.
- Missile Launch: If conditions are favorable, the missile is launched.
- Defense System: If an enemy missile is detected, countermeasures are deployed.
